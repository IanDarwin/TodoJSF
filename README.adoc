= TodoService - World's least awesome Web View and REST Service for TODO

This will be a nice working TODO app by 2022..
For now it provides a trivial ToDo lister/editor for one person via HTML (JSF).

Uses ../TodoModel for its JPA Data; do mvn install in that project first.

It will someday soon also provide a REST interface, which will be awesome enough
that there will also be an Android Synch Service to go with it.

You need to copy config-sample.properties to config.properties, and edit it.

Assuming you're using Wildfly 8 or 9 and PostGres 9,, just set up the datasource and do `mvn wildfly:deploy`


Things do do.

Better UI!

Move away from container-managed security so it can more easily become multi-user.
